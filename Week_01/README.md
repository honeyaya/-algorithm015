#### Problem Notes

* Three sum
  
  one + two sum: (double pointer or set)

* Moving zero


* Reverse Linked List

  easy to forget - sequence of change the order,
  to remember:
  
  1. temp next in iterative process
  2. twist back current pointing direction
  3. current finally move to next
  4. return prev

* Rotate Array

  1. easy to find one extra array solution
  2. three reverse is good and tricky:
	a.  reverse the whole array
	b.  reverse first k 
	c.  reverse the rest

* Linked List Cyle

  1. coding has tough spot, if while loop to control slow != fast, then initial state should be different
